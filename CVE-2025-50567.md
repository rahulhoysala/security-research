## CVE-2025-50567 - SQL Injection in Saurus CMS Community Edition v4.7.1

**Discovered by:** [Rahul Hoysala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-hoysala/)
**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-50567
**Severity:** Critical
**Date Published:** August 15, 2025

---

## Summary

A **critical SQL injection vulnerability** was discovered in the custom **DB::prepare function**, which uses **preg_replace()** with the deprecated **/e** modifier to interpolate SQL query parameters (deprecated in PHP 5.5 and removed in PHP 7) in**Saurus CMS Community Edition v4.7.1**. This leads to **direct evaluation of user-controlled SQL statements**, potentially leading to **arbitrary PHP code execution**. 

---

## Affected Component

- **File:** `classes/mysql.inc.php`
- **Function:** `prepare()`
- **Line:** [354](https://github.com/sauruscms/Saurus-CMS-Community-Edition/blob/master/classes/mysql.inc.php#L354)
- **Commit:** `6fffcf0`
- **Product:** Saurus CMS Community Edition v4.7.1
- **Vendor:** Saurus OÃœ
- **Access Required:** None

---

## Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability lies in the funtion `prepare()`, in this particular line:
```php
$sql = preg_replace("/\?/e", '"\'".$args[++$i]."\'"', $sql, 50);
```
The `/e` modifier in `preg_replace()` evaluates the replacement string as PHP code. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code into the query string, which is then evaluated by PHP. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

## Impact

- Disclosure of sensitive data and PII
- Potential full control over database
- Potential RCE

---

## Proof of Concept

```php
' SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = \'1; system("ls");\''
```
Parameter input is supposed to be accepted in a sanitized manner, but the problem arises with the `/e` modifier, which would replace the placeholder value with unsafe user-controlled parameters, which in this case is directly executed as PHP code due to the nature of the modifier.

## CVSS Score

**Base Score:** 9.1 (Critical)
**Vector:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N`

> Remote exploitation, low attack complexity, no privileges required, no user interaction required, unchanged scope, high loss of confidentiality, high loss of integrity, no loss of availability.

---

## Recommended Remediation

- Remove usage of `/e` modifier.
- Sanitize all SQL parameter input.
- Upgrade to PHP 7.0 or later.
- Remove the custom `prepare()` function.
- Use secure database abstraction layers like PDO or MySQLi.

---

## Example Fix:

Replace this:
```php
$sql = preg_replace("/\?/e", '"\'".$args[++$i]."\'"', $sql, 50);
```
with this:
```php
$sql = preg_replace_callback("/\?/", function($matches) use (&$i, $args) {
    return '\'' . $args[++$i] . '\'';
}, $sql, 50);
```
In this case, the `/e` modifier is replaced with `preg_replace_callback()`, the callback function takes the matched value and returns the safely quoted parameter from `$args[++$i]`, which is wrapped in single quotes to ensure proper SQL syntax.
